# FutureBit - Apollo
A guide for getting started with the [FutureBit](https://www.futurebit.io/) Apollo Bitcoin node & miner. The Apollo is a full archival Bitcoin node, currently running Bitcoin Core v22.0.0. Additionally, the Apollo is a Bitcoin miner equipped with 44 ASIC chips capable of producing nearly 3 Terra Hash (Th). The Apollo is built on a revamped platform featuring a 6-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. The Apollo can go from delivery to hashing at a pool of your choice in less than 15-minutes and it can sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain in 2-days.

The Apollo brings the full Bitcoin ecosystem back into one device. The wallet, the node, and the minier are all contained in one cohesive device that anybody can run quietly on their desk. As the technology in Bitcoin has advanced over the years there has been a fragmentation from the way users interacted with the Bitcoin software; dedicated wallet, node, & mining companies/projects have evolved from what was once all running in an application on a personal computer. 

As large mining pools draw in more hash rate, the Bitcoin network becomes more centralized and escaping regulatory capture becomes more difficult. Not everyone can or will want to run industrial-grade miners in their home. The +80 dB noise levels and the +150° F temperatures can be difficult to manage. Although there are a great many resources available for DIY enthusiasts interested in joining the Bitcoin home mining renaissance, the Apollo is designed with a more broad user base in mind. The Apollo runs quietly at ~20dB, takes about 15 minutes to install and connect to a pool, and the user interface makes interacting with it user friendly.
