# Connecting to a Bitcoin Mining Pool
This section will show you how to connect to a Bitcoin mining pool. After the Apollo completed the automatic initial configuration, it started hashing. This is idicated by the steady flashing red light on the front of the device and the cooling fan running. 

If you connected a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the Apollo then you should be greeted with a login screen after all the system level configurations are complete. The password should be `futurebit123`. 

Otherwise, if you are running the Apollo remotely, then you need to find the local IP address on your network. The easiest way to do this is by logging into your router and checking the list of devices under the DHCP leases section. Your router should have a sticker with the local IP address needed to login along with the password. If not, the directions are usually pretty easy to find with an online search for your manufacturer's router. Typically, you can just type `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1` or `10.0.0.1` into your web browser and that will bring you to your router login page. From there the username/password can vary depending on manufacturer but they are usually something like `admin/admin` or `admin/1234` or `admin/password`. Alternatively, programs like [AngryIP](https://angryip.org/) may be used to scan your network for all active IP addresses. You should be able to find the IP address for your Apollo next to the device named `futurebit-btc` in your DHCP leases list.
